                        I started to take photos of street art while I was living in Perth and one day, I just quit my job. 
                        Whilst walking around town afterwards, I then looked up and saw a 5-storey street art, and snap, that was the start! 
                        I was so excited to move back to London knowing the amount of street art I could photograph in my hometown.

                        I love street art because of the energy I get from the art, 
                        whether it be a mural, paste up, stencil art, sticker art, etc. 
                        The street art scene in London changes every day as more artists create day to day on the same walls, 
                        I love capturing a moment of creativity before it disappears.

                    Paris, New York and Berlin. ALO started his career in London where he began painting 
                    on the walls and working with art galleries. He had his first major solo show "Hail to the loser" 
                    at Saatchi Gallery in 2014, with which he started a continuous collaboration. His second solo show
